## base64maker

I needed a fast way to make base64 encoded files when I was trying to learn about twine2 visual novel creator.

This script loads images or audio and spits out a base64 encoded version that you can cut and paste.

It uses system modules only, and does not require an environment or any other installed modules.

Opoen the .html file it creates to get the base64 code.
